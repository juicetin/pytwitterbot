# Twitter Competition Bot (Python)

Very rudimentary script to automate entering Python competitions. Planning to fix this up with testing and DB to store currently following list/etc. to cycle through old follows with new ones, as my 'dummy' account is currently capped at 5000 following and 1000 followers.

Won a handful of things to date, like geek coding t-shirts, posters, football club biographies, random DVDs, etc!
